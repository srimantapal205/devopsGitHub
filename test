Project Title: Deploy Angular Application in Docker Container
Note: This is a solution document on how the demonstration is performed on Docker 18. + Version.
Install Angular application on Ubuntu by running the commands mentioned below: 
sudo apt-get update
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
apt-get install -y nodejs
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new myAng-app
cd myAng-app

Navigate inside the project, and create a Dockerfile. 
vi  Dockerfile
Now add the following content to it. 
# base image
FROM node:12

# set working directory
RUN mkdir /usr/src/app
WORKDIR /usr/src/app

# add `/usr/src/app/node_modules/.bin` to $PATH
ENV PATH /usr/src/app/node_modules/.bin:$PATH

# install and cache app dependencies
COPY package.json /usr/src/app/package.json
RUN npm install
RUN npm install -g @angular/cli@1.7.1

# add app
COPY . /usr/src/app

# start app
CMD ng serve --host 0.0.0.0
Build and tag the docker image. 
docker build -t myangularapp .
Exit the execution of application, and now run the Angular application in docker detach mode. 
docker run -d -p 4200:4200 myangularapp
Now, open the browser, and you should be able to run the application in the browser by navigating to the URL mentioned below.
http://localhost:4200
You will be able to load the Angular application page in your browser. 
Now, check if the container is running.
